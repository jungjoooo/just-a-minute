# Pupil Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction

This repository contains the preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline used in our study.  
The code cleans raw pupil-dilation time-series data and computes a set of features for statistical analysis and machine learning.

## 1. Files in this repository

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sample.csv` | An anonymized example of the raw input format (one participant). |
| `data.csv` | Full anonymized raw dataset used for ML analysis. |
| `preprocessing.py` | Cleans the raw data and produces `cleaned.csv`. |
| `cleaned.csv` | Output generated by the preprocessing script. |
| `feature-extraction.py` | Extracts time-series features and produces `samples.csv`. |

## 2. How to run the pipeline

### Step 1 — Preprocessing  
Run the following command to generate a cleaned version of the raw data:

```bash
python3 preprocessing.py
```

This will produce:

```
cleaned.csv
```

### Step 2 — Feature Extraction  
Run the following command to compute pupil-dilation features (peak, latency, AUC, change-sum, standardized metrics, etc.):

```bash
python3 feature-extraction.py
```

This will produce:

```
samples.csv
```

## 3. Notes

- `sample.csv` demonstrates the expected input format but is not used for analysis.  
- `data.csv` contains the anonymized dataset used in the study.  
- All participant identifiers were anonymized; no identifiable information is included.  
- The preprocessing pipeline removes non-stimulus frames, detects and interpolates outliers, and enforces physiological limits on pupil size (40–160 units).
